The first character indicates the type of input.

    "-" indicates a file

    "d" indicates a directory

    "i" indicates a link (a symlink, which is a shortcut to a file/directory)

*-rwxrwxrwx*

useradd [OPTIONS] <user_name>

groupadd [OPTIONS] <group_name>

Add user to the group

sudo usermod -aG <group_name> <user_name>

List groups in a system

cat /etc/group

You can use the chown command to change the ownership of a file. The chown command is abbreviated from "change owner". 

chown <user_name> <file_name>

chown --reference=<source_file_name> <destination_file_name>

sudo chown <user_name> file1 file2 ...

To change group ownership

sudo chgrp <group_name> <file/dir_name>

chmod <user><group><others> <file_name>

To change both the owner and the group of a file use the chown command followed by the new owner and group separated by a colon (:)

with no intervening spaces and the target file.

chown USER:GROUP FILE

The following command will change the ownership of a file named file1 to a new owner named linuxize and group users:

chown linuxize:users file1

If you omit the group name after the colon (:), the group of the file is changed to the specified user’s login group:

chown linuxize: file1

sudo chgrp admin group_test/

sudo chgrp -R admin group_test/
chmod +r <filename>

chmod +w <filename>

chmod +x <filename>

chmod -r <filename>

chmod -rwx <filename>

Add or Remove permissions recursively to all sub-directories

sudo chmod -R <permission> <filename>

chmod u+rwx,go+r <filename>

What is an ACL?
An access control list (ACL) lets you assign permissions for each unique user or group. Suppose you have user1, user2, and user3 on a system.

Users user2 and user3 are part of a demo group. You must assign this permission scheme to the sample directory:

user1: read and write permission

user2: read permission

You can use the setfacl and getfacl command utilities to assign and verify the ACL of a file or directory. To set an ACL, use the setfacl command with the --modify (-m for short) option:

$ setfacl --modify user1:rw sample

$ setfactl –modify user2:r sample

setfacl -m u:user1:rw \

-m u:user2:r \

-m u:user3:rwx \

-m g:demo1:rw \

-m g:demo2:rwx \

-m o:r sample


View the ACLs using the getfacl command:

$ getfacl sample

# file: sample

# owner: tux

# group: tux

user::rwx

user:user1:rw-

user:user2:r--

user:user3:rwx

group::r-x

group:demo1:rw-

group:demo2:rwx

mask::rwx

other::r--
